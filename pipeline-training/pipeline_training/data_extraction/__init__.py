data_extraction module

This module is a critical component of the MLOps pipeline, tasked with the
responsibility of data procurement. It interfaces directly with various data
warehouses, extracting data that has been subjected to standard ETL/ELT
(Extract, Transform, Load) processes.

The primary objective of this module is to facilitate the downstream tasks
within the MLOps pipeline, predominantly the machine learning operations.
By sourcing and providing access to cleansed, organized, and transformed data
from warehouses, it establishes the foundational basis for all ensuing tasks.
